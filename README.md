# T20 World Cup '22 detailed analysis

Checkout this amazing work done by me with the help of Dhaval sir (Codebasics) wherein I'm doing a detailed analysis of the latest T20 world cup to come up with a team of the 11 best players. The incredible 11, if ever played in a team could beat any other team!

# Web scrapping
I used an online tool (brightdata.com) for scrapping the required data from the very popular espncricinfo website.

# Software requirement
1. Notepad ++ (optional) - Has a good plugin for auto formating the json data
2. Juypter notebook / Google Colab
